<h1>Training Alias<img align="right" src="../Data/image.png" width="100px"></h1>

Training alias that allows players to train in various proficiencies. Allows for customization of training settings. This does take into account Fey Wanderer Ranger's ability to add their wisdom modifier to charisma ability checks. You can also manage what proficiencies players can learn and what ability score is used for each.

This does require cvar `subclass` to contain `Fey Wanderer`, otherwise the bonus will need to be manually done.

## Help:
`!train <prof_name> <-b> <adv/dis> <i>`

`prof_name`: If the training has not started prof_name is required. If continuing training you do not add it.

`-b`: Adds bonus to check.

`-i`: Ignores training cooldown (DO NOT USE EXCEPT WHEN TOLD BY AN ADMIN, the alias does keep track if this was used).

`adv`/`dis`/`eadv`: Applies advantage/disadvantage/double advantage.
